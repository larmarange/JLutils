}
\usage{
cutree.order(tree, k = NULL, h = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{an \code{\link{hclust}} object}

\item{k}{the desired number of groups}

\item{h}{height where the tree is to be cut}
}
\description{
Cut a tree (result from \link{hclust}) into groups of data.
Groups are in the order of the tree leafs.
}
\note{
The A2R package has not been updated since January 2006 and cannot be installed
anymore with a recent version of R. It's why this function has been copied here.

h77 <- hclust(dist(state.x77))
